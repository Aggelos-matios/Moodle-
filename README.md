# Moodle-

I created my own moodle site for academic purposes. The site is completed and fully functional. The instructions from my professor were to contain some basic things like a navigation menu, student-teacher accounts, images etc.

The structure is quite simple, but in order to work locally on the machine some kind of software that achieves communication with the database (eg XAMPP) must be installed. Obviously, to complete the purpose of the academic work, the files were also uploaded to PLESK, but unfortunately the website remained unmaintained.
